fifty prayers on them.' Moses said, 'Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers 
will not be able to bear it.' (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to 
half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, 'Go back to your Lord as your

read, but again I replied, ""I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?)."" Thereupon he caught 
me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, ""Read: In the Name of your Lord, 
Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most 
Generous...up to..... ..that which he knew not."" (96.15) 
Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles twitching with terror till he 
entered upon Khadija and said, ""Cover me! Cover me!"" They covered him till his fear was over and 
then he said, ""O Khadija, what is wrong with me?"" Then he told her everything that had happened and 
said, 'I fear that something may happen to me."" Khadija said, 'Never! But have the glad tidings, for by 
Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the 
truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamityafflicted 
ones."" Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 
`Abdul `Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father's brother, who 
during the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to 
write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost 
his eyesight. Khadija said to him, ""O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew."" Waraqa asked, 
""O my nephew! What have you seen?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. 
Waraqa said, ""This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah 
had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn 
you out."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, ""Will they turn me out?"" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: 
""Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with 
hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you 
strongly."" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while 
and the Prophet (ﷺ) became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from 
the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself 
down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, ""O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in 
truth"" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And 
whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but 
when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he 
had said before. (Ibn `Abbas said regarding the meaning of: 'He it is that Cleaves the daybreak (from

'Abdur-Rahman Himyari set out for pilgrimage or for 'Umrah and said:,"Should it so happen that we come into contact with one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him about what is talked abouttaqdir(Divine Decree). Accidentally we came across Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) on his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my companion would authorize me to speak. I therefore said: Abu Abdur Rahman! There have appeared some people in our land who recite the Qur'an and pursue knowledge. And then after talking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that there is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not predestined. He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no way responsible for my (belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and spent it (in the way of Allah), Allah would not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we were sitting in the company of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him. None amongst us recognized him. At last he sat with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed his palms on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and you establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the expense of) the journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he would put the question and then he would himself verify the truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about good and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (the inquirer) again said: Inform me about al-Ihsan (performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see Him, He, verily, sees you. He (the enquirer) again said: Inform me about the hour (of the Doom).
