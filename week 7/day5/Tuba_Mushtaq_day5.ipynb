      "      Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:                          Allah's Apostle was the most generous of all the people, and he used      to reach the peak in generosity in the month of Ramadan when Gabriel      met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramadan to teach him      the Qur'an. Allah's Apostle was the most generous person, even more      generous than the strong uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste      to do charitable deeds).\n",
      "      Narrated Ibn 'Umar:                          Allah's Apostle said: Islam is based on (the following) five      (principles):     1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and      Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.     2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and      perfectly.     3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity) .     4. To perform Hajj. (i.e. Pilgrimage to Mecca)     5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.\n",
      "      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          Allah's Apostle said: \"Whoever establishes prayers during the nights      of Ramadan faithfully out of sincere faith and hoping to attain      Allah's rewards (not for showing off), all his past sins will be      forgiven.\"\n",
      "      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          Allah's Apostle said, \"Whoever observes fasts during the month of      Ramadan out of sincere faith, and hoping to attain Allah's rewards,      then all his past sins will be forgiven.\"\n",
      "      Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaidullah:                          A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and we heard     his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he      came near and then we came to know that he was asking about Islam.      Allah's Apostle said, \"You have to offer prayers perfectly five times      in a day and night (24 hours).\" The man asked, \"Is there any more      (praying)?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"No, but if you want to offer the     Nawafil prayers (you can).\" Allah's Apostle further said to him: \"You      have to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.\" The man asked,      \"Is there any more fasting?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"No, but if you      want to observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)\" Then Allah's Apostle      further said to him, \"You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity).\"     The man asked, \"Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to      pay?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"No, unless you want to give alms of      your own.\" And then that man retreated saying, \"By Allah! I will      neither do less nor more than this.\" Allah's Apostle said, \"If what he     said is true, then he will be successful (i.e. he will be granted      Paradise).\"\n",
      " Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit:                           \"Allah's Apostle went out to inform the people about the (date of the)     night of decree (Al-Qadr) but there happened a quarrel between two      Muslim men. The Prophet said, \"I came out to inform you about (the      date of) the night of Al-Qadr, but as so and so and so and so      quarrelled, its knowledge was taken away (I forgot it) and maybe it      was better for you. Now look for it in the 7th, the 9th and the 5th      (of the last 10 nights of the month of Ramadan).\"\n",
      "      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          One day while the Prophet was sitting in the company of some people,      (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, \"What is faith?\" Allah's Apostle      replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with     Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection.\" Then he further      asked, \"What is Islam?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"To worship Allah      Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory      charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.\"       Then he further asked, \"What is Ihsan (perfection)?\" Allah's Apostle      replied, \"To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot      achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is      looking at you.\" Then he further asked, \"When will the Hour be      established?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"The answerer has no better      knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its      portents.     1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.     2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing      with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is      one of five things which nobody knows except Allah.     The Prophet then recited: \"Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge     of the Hour--.\" (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet      asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him.      Then the Prophet said, \"That was Gabriel who came to teach the people      their religion.\" Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all      that as a part of faith.\n",
      "      Narrated Abu Jamra:                          I used to sit with Ibn 'Abbas and he made me sit on his sitting place.     He requested me to stay with him in order that he might give me a      share from his property. So I stayed with him for two months. Once he      told (me) that when the delegation of the tribe of 'Abdul Qais came to     the Prophet, the Prophet asked them, \"Who are the people (i.e. you)?      (Or) who are the delegate?\" They replied, \"We are from the tribe of      Rabi'a.\" Then the Prophet said to them, \"Welcome! O people (or O      delegation of 'Abdul Qais)! Neither will you have disgrace nor will      you regret.\" They said, \"O Allah's Apostle! We cannot come to you      except in the sacred month and there is the infidel tribe of Mudar      intervening between you and us. So please order us to do something      good (religious deeds) so that we may inform our people whom we have      left behind (at home), and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on      them).\" Then they asked about drinks (what is legal and what is      illegal). The Prophet ordered them to do four things and forbade them      from four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah Alone and asked      them, \"Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?\" They      replied, \"Allah and His Apostle know better.\" Thereupon the Prophet      said, \"It means:     1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and      Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.      2. To offer prayers perfectly     3. To pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)      4. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.     5. And to pay Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah's     Cause).     Then he forbade them four things, namely, Hantam, Dubba,' Naqir Ann      Muzaffat or Muqaiyar; (These were the names of pots in which Alcoholic     drinks were prepared) (The Prophet mentioned the container of wine and     he meant the wine itself). The Prophet further said (to them):      \"Memorize them (these instructions) and convey them to the people whom     you have left behind.\"\n",
      " Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     While we were sitting with the Prophet in the mosque, a man came riding on a camel. He made his camel kneel down in the mosque, tied its foreleg and then said: \"Who amongst you is Muhammad?\" At that time the Prophet was sitting amongst us (his companions) leaning on his arm. We replied, \"This white man reclining on his arm.\" The man then addressed him, \"O Son of `Abdul Muttalib.\" The Prophet said, \"I am here to answer your questions.\" The man said to the Prophet, \"I want to ask you something and will be hard in questioning. So do not get angry.\" The Prophet said, \"Ask whatever you want.\" The man said, \"I ask you by your Lord, and the Lord of those who were before you, has Allah sent you as an Apostle to all the mankind?\" The Prophet replied, \"By Allah, yes.\" The man further said, \"I ask you by Allah. Has Allah ordered you to offer five prayers in a day and night (24 hours).? He replied, \"By Allah, Yes.\" The man further said, \"I ask you by Allah! Has Allah ordered you to observe fasts during this month of the year (i.e. Ramadan)?\" He replied, \"By Allah, Yes.\" The man further said, \"I ask you by Allah. Has Allah ordered you to take Zakat (obligatory charity) from our rich people and distribute it amongst our poor people?\" The Prophet replied, \"By Allah, yes.\" Thereupon that man said, \"I have believed in all that with which you have been sent, and I have been sent by my people as a messenger, and I am Dimam bin Tha`laba from the brothers of Bani Sa`d bin Bakr.\"\n",
      " Narrated Abu Jamra:                     I was an interpreter between the people and Ibn `Abbas. Once Ibn `Abbas said that a delegation of the tribe of `Abdul Qais came to the Prophet who asked them, \"Who are the people (i.e. you)? (Or) who are the delegates?\" They replied, \"We are from the tribe of Rabi`a.\" Then the Prophet said to them, \"Welcome, O people (or said, \"O delegation (of `Abdul Qais).\") Neither will you have disgrace nor will you regret.\" They said, \"We have come to you from a distant place and there is the tribe of the infidels of Mudar intervening between you and us and we cannot come to you except in the sacred month. So please order us to do something good (religious deeds) and that we may also inform our people whom we have left behind (at home) and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on them.)\" The Prophet ordered them to do four things, and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah Alone, the Honorable the Majestic and said to them, \"Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?\" They replied, \"Allah and His Apostle know better.\" Thereupon the Prophet said, \"(That means to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay Zakat, to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan, (and) to pay Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah's cause).\" Then he forbade them four things, namely Ad-Dubba.' Hantam, Muzaffat (and) An-Naqir or Muqaiyar (These were the names of pots in which alcoholic drinks used to be prepared). The Prophet further said, \"Memorize them (these instructions) and tell them to the people whom you have left behind.\"\n",
      " Narrated `Aisha:                     On the 1st of Dhul-Hijja we set out with the intention of performing Hajj. Allah's Apostle said, \"Any one who likes to assume the Ihram for `Umra he can do so. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed the Ihram for `Umra. \"Some of us assumed the Ihram for `Umra while the others assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who assumed the Ihram for `Umra. I got menses and kept on menstruating until the day of `Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet . He told me to postpone my `Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assure the Ihram of Hajj and I did so. On the right of Hasba, he sent my brother `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to at-Tan`im, where I assumed the Ihram for `Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, \"For that (`Umra) no Hadi, fasting or alms were required.\n",
      " Narrated Zainab bint Abi Salama:                     Um-Salama said, \"I got my menses while I was lying with the Prophet under a woolen sheet. So I slipped away, took the clothes for menses and put them on. Allah's Apostle said, 'Have you got your menses?' I replied, 'Yes.' Then he called me and took me with him under the woolen sheet.\" Um Salama further said, \"The Prophet used to kiss me while he was fasting. The Prophet and I used to take the bath of Janaba from a single pot.\"\n"

He knoweth that there are sick folk among you, while others travel in the land in search of Allah’s bounty, and others (still) are fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite of it that which is easy (for you), and establish worship and pay the poor-due, and (so) lend unto Allah a goodly loan. Whatsoever good ye send before you for your souls, ye will find it with Allah, better and greater in the recompense. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.\n",
