      "      Narrated Ibn 'Umar:                          Allah's Apostle said: Islam is based on (the following) five      (principles):     1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and      Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.     2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and      perfectly.     3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity) .     4. To perform Hajj. (i.e. Pilgrimage to Mecca)     5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.\n",
      "      Narrated Ibn 'Umar:                          Allah's Apostle said: \"I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight against     the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped     but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Apostle, and offer the prayers      perfectly and give the obligatory charity, so if they perform that,      then they save their lives and property from me except for Islamic laws     and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah.\"\n",
      "      Narrated 'Aisha:                          Once the Prophet came while a woman was sitting with me. He said, \"Who     is she?\" I replied, \"She is so and so,\" and told him about her      (excessive) praying. He said disapprovingly, \"Do (good) deeds which is     within your capacity (without being overtaxed) as Allah does not get      tired (of giving rewards) but (surely) you will get tired and the best     deed (act of Worship) in the sight of Allah is that which is done      regularly.\"\n",
      "      Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaidullah:                          A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and we heard     his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he      came near and then we came to know that he was asking about Islam.      Allah's Apostle said, \"You have to offer prayers perfectly five times      in a day and night (24 hours).\" The man asked, \"Is there any more      (praying)?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"No, but if you want to offer the     Nawafil prayers (you can).\" Allah's Apostle further said to him: \"You      have to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.\" The man asked,      \"Is there any more fasting?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"No, but if you      want to observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)\" Then Allah's Apostle      further said to him, \"You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity).\"     The man asked, \"Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to      pay?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"No, unless you want to give alms of      your own.\" And then that man retreated saying, \"By Allah! I will      neither do less nor more than this.\" Allah's Apostle said, \"If what he     said is true, then he will be successful (i.e. he will be granted      Paradise).\"\n",
      "      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          One day while the Prophet was sitting in the company of some people,      (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, \"What is faith?\" Allah's Apostle      replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with     Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection.\" Then he further      asked, \"What is Islam?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"To worship Allah      Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory      charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.\"       Then he further asked, \"What is Ihsan (perfection)?\" Allah's Apostle      replied, \"To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot      achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is      looking at you.\" Then he further asked, \"When will the Hour be      established?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"The answerer has no better      knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its      portents.     1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.     2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing      with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is      one of five things which nobody knows except Allah.     The Prophet then recited: \"Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge     of the Hour--.\" (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet      asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him.      Then the Prophet said, \"That was Gabriel who came to teach the people      their religion.\" Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all      that as a part of faith.\n",
      "      Narrated Abu Jamra:                          I used to sit with Ibn 'Abbas and he made me sit on his sitting place.     He requested me to stay with him in order that he might give me a      share from his property. So I stayed with him for two months. Once he      told (me) that when the delegation of the tribe of 'Abdul Qais came to     the Prophet, the Prophet asked them, \"Who are the people (i.e. you)?      (Or) who are the delegate?\" They replied, \"We are from the tribe of      Rabi'a.\" Then the Prophet said to them, \"Welcome! O people (or O      delegation of 'Abdul Qais)! Neither will you have disgrace nor will      you regret.\" They said, \"O Allah's Apostle! We cannot come to you      except in the sacred month and there is the infidel tribe of Mudar      intervening between you and us. So please order us to do something      good (religious deeds) so that we may inform our people whom we have      left behind (at home), and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on      them).\" Then they asked about drinks (what is legal and what is      illegal). The Prophet ordered them to do four things and forbade them      from four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah Alone and asked      them, \"Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?\" They      replied, \"Allah and His Apostle know better.\" Thereupon the Prophet      said, \"It means:     1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and      Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.      2. To offer prayers perfectly     3. To pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)      4. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.     5. And to pay Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah's     Cause).     Then he forbade them four things, namely, Hantam, Dubba,' Naqir Ann      Muzaffat or Muqaiyar; (These were the names of pots in which Alcoholic     drinks were prepared) (The Prophet mentioned the container of wine and     he meant the wine itself). The Prophet further said (to them):      \"Memorize them (these instructions) and convey them to the people whom     you have left behind.\"\n",
      "      Narrated Abu Mas'ud:                          The Prophet said, \"If a man spends on his family (with the intention      of having a reward from Allah) sincerely for Allah's sake then it is a     (kind of) alms-giving in reward for him.\n",
      "      Narrated Jarir bin Abdullah:                          I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah's Apostle for the following:     1. offer prayers perfectly      2. pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)     3. and be sincere and true to every Muslim.\n",
      " Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     While we were sitting with the Prophet in the mosque, a man came riding on a camel. He made his camel kneel down in the mosque, tied its foreleg and then said: \"Who amongst you is Muhammad?\" At that time the Prophet was sitting amongst us (his companions) leaning on his arm. We replied, \"This white man reclining on his arm.\" The man then addressed him, \"O Son of `Abdul Muttalib.\" The Prophet said, \"I am here to answer your questions.\" The man said to the Prophet, \"I want to ask you something and will be hard in questioning. So do not get angry.\" The Prophet said, \"Ask whatever you want.\" The man said, \"I ask you by your Lord, and the Lord of those who were before you, has Allah sent you as an Apostle to all the mankind?\" The Prophet replied, \"By Allah, yes.\" The man further said, \"I ask you by Allah. Has Allah ordered you to offer five prayers in a day and night (24 hours).? He replied, \"By Allah, Yes.\" The man further said, \"I ask you by Allah! Has Allah ordered you to observe fasts during this month of the year (i.e. Ramadan)?\" He replied, \"By Allah, Yes.\" The man further said, \"I ask you by Allah. Has Allah ordered you to take Zakat (obligatory charity) from our rich people and distribute it amongst our poor people?\" The Prophet replied, \"By Allah, yes.\" Thereupon that man said, \"I have believed in all that with which you have been sent, and I have been sent by my people as a messenger, and I am Dimam bin Tha`laba from the brothers of Bani Sa`d bin Bakr.\"\n",
      " Narrated Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari:                     Once a man said to Allah's Apostle \"O Allah's Apostle! I may not attend the (compulsory congregational) prayer because so and so (the Imam) prolongs the prayer when he leads us for it. The narrator added: \"I never saw the Prophet more furious in giving advice than he was on that day. The Prophet said, \"O people! Some of you make others dislike good deeds (the prayers). So whoever leads the people in prayer should shorten it because among them there are the sick the weak and the needy (having some jobs to do).\n",
      "      Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:                          Once Allah's Apostle came out while Bilal was accompanying him. He      went towards the women thinking that they had not heard him (i.e. his      sermon). So he preached them and ordered them to pay alms. (Hearing      that) the women started giving alms; some donated their ear-rings,      some gave their rings and Bilal was collecting them in the corner of      his garment.\n",
      " Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet forbade two kinds of sales i.e. Al-Limais and An-Nibadh (the former is a kind of sale in which the deal is completed if the buyer touches a thing, without seeing or checking it properly and the latter is a kind of a sale in which the deal is completed when the seller throws a thing towards the buyer giving him no opportunity to see, touch or check it) and (the Prophet forbade) also Ishtimal-As- Samma' and Al-Ihtiba' in a single garment.\n"

      "Ayah: And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but Allah hath cursed them for their unbelief. Little is that which they believe.\n",
      "Ayah: And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear (Our Word), they said: We hear and we rebel. And (worship of) the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection (of the covenant). Say (unto them): Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers.\n",
      "Ayah: Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetime ? He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain road.\n",
      "Ayah: Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth hath become manifest unto them. Forgive and be indulgent (toward them) until Allah give command. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.\n",
      "Ayah: Or say ye that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes were Jews or Christians ? Say: Do ye know best, or doth Allah ? And who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah ? Allah is not unaware of what ye do.\n",
      "Ayah: Thus We have appointed you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you. And We appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We might know him who followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his heels. In truth it was a hard (test) save for those whom Allah guided. But it was not Allah’s purpose that your faith should be in vain, for Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful toward mankind.\n",
      "Ayah: They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn (men) from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing. And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso becometh a renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter. Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein.\n",
      "Ayah: O ye who believe! When ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it in writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you in (terms of) equity. No scribe should refuse to write as Allah hath taught him, so let him write, and let him who incurreth the debt dictate, and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord, and diminish naught thereof. But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding, or weak, or unable himself to dictate, then let the guardian of his interests dictate in (terms of) equity. And call to witness, from among your men, two witnesses. And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses, so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness)the other will remember. And the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. Be not averse to writing down (the contract) whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah anfd more sure for testimony, and the best way of avoiding doubt between you; save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin for you if ye write it not. And have witness when ye sell one to another, and let no harm be done to scribe or witness. If ye do (harm to them) lo! it is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah. Allah is teaching you. And Allah is knower of all things.\n",
      "Ayah: If ye be on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a pledge in hand (shall suffice). And if one of you entrusteth to another let him who is trusted deliver up that which is entrusted to him (according to the pact between them) and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord. Hide not testimony. He who hideth it, verily his heart is sinful. Allah is Aware of what ye do.\n",
      "Ayah: But when Jesus became conscious of their disbelief, he cried: Who will be my helpers in the cause of Allah ? The disciples said: We will be Allah’s helpers. We believe in Allah, and bear thou witness that we have surrendered (unto Him).\n",
      "Ayah: It is not (possible) for any human being unto whom Allah had given the Scripture and wisdom and the prophethood that he should afterwards have said unto mankind: Be slaves of me instead of Allah; but (what he said was): Be ye faithful servants of the Lord by virtue of your constant teaching of the Scripture and of your constant study thereof.\n",
      "Ayah: How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and (after) they bore witness that the messenger is true and after clear proofs (of Allah’s Sovereignty) had come unto them. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.\n",
      "Ayah: Lo! those who disbelieve after their (profession of) belief, and afterward grow violent in disbelief: their repentance will not be accepted. And such are those who are astray.\n",
      "Ayah: Lo! those who disbelieve, and die in disbelief, the (whole) earth full of gold would not be accepted from such an one if it were offered as a ransom (for his soul). Theirs will be a painful doom and they will have no helpers.\n",
      "Ayah: O ye who believe! If ye obey a party of those who have received the Scripture they will make you disbelievers after your belief.\n",
      "Ayah: On the Day when (some) faces will be whitened and (some) faces will be blackened; and as for those whose faces have been blackened, it will be said unto them: Disbelieved ye after your (profession of) belief ? Then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved.\n",
      "Ayah: And that He might know the hypocrites, unto whom it was said: Come, fight in the way of Allah, or defend yourselves. They answered: If we knew aught of fighting we would follow you. On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith. They utter with their mouths a thing which is not in their hearts. Allah is Best Aware of what they hide.\n",
      "Ayah: Those unto whom men said: Lo! the people have gathered against you, therefor fear them. (The threat of danger) but increased the faith of them and they cried: Allah is Sufficient for us! Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust!\n",
      "Ayah: Let not their conduct grieve thee, who run easily to disbelief, for lo! they injure Allah not at all. It is Allah’s Will to assign them no portion in the Hereafter, and theirs will be an awful doom.\n",
      "Ayah: Those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith harm Allah not at all, but theirs will be a painful doom.\n",
      "Ayah: Our Lord! Lo! we have heard a crier calling unto Faith: \"Believe ye in your Lord!\" So we believed. Our Lord! Therefor forgive us our sins, and remit from us our evil deeds, and make us die the death of the righteous.\n",
      "Ayah: And whoso is not able to afford to marry free, believing women, let them marry from the believing maids whom your right hands possess. Allah knoweth best (concerning) your faith. Ye (proceed) one from another; so wed them by permission of their folk, and give unto them their portions in kindness, they being honest, not debauched nor of loose conduct. And if when they are honourably married they commit lewdness they shall incur the half of the punishment (prescribed) for free women (in that case). This is for him among you who feareth to commit sin. But to have patience would be better for you. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.\n",
      "Ayah: Some of those who are Jews change words from their context and say: \"We hear and disobey; hear thou as one who heareth not\" and \"Listen to us!\" distorting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said: \"We hear and we obey: hear thou, and look at us\" it had been better for them, and more upright. But Allah hath cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, save a few.\n",
      "Ayah: What aileth you that ye are become two parties regarding the hypocrites, when Allah cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they earned ? Seek ye to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray ? He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him thou (O MUhammad) canst not find a road.\n",
      "Ayah: Lo! those who believe, then disbelieve and then (again) believe, then disbelieve, and then increase in disbelief, Allah will never pardon them, nor will He guide them unto a way.\n",
      "Ayah: Then because of their breaking of their covenant, and their disbelieving in the revelations of Allah, and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully, and their saying: Our hearts are hardened - Nay, but Allah set a seal upon them for their disbelief, so that they believe not save a few -\n",
      "Ayah: And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a tremendous calumny;\n",
      "Ayah: This day are (all) good things made lawful for you. The food of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. And so are the virtuous women of the believers and the virtuous women of those who received the Scripture before you (lawful for you) when ye give them their marriage portions and live with them in honour, not in fornication, nor taking them as secret concubines. Whoso denieth the faith, his work is vain and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter.\n",
      "Ayah: O Messenger! Let not them grieve thee who vie one with another in the race to disbelief, of such as say with their mouths: \"We believe,\" but their hearts believe not, and of the Jews: listeners for the sake of falsehood, listeners on behalf of other folk who come not unto thee, changing words from their context and saying: If this be given unto you, receive it, but if this be not given unto you, then beware! He whom Allah doometh unto sin, thou (by thine efforts) wilt avail him naught against Allah. Those are they for whom the Will of Allah is that He cleanse not their hearts. Theirs in the world will be ignominy, and in the Hereafter an awful doom;\n",
      "Ayah: Is it a judgment of the time of (pagan) ignorance that they are seeking ? Who is better than Allah for judgment to a people who have certainty (in their belief) ?\n",
      "Ayah: When they come unto you (Muslims), they say: We believe; but they came in unbelief and they went out in the same; and Allah knoweth best what they were hiding.\n",
      "Ayah: The Jews say: Allah’s hand is fettered. Their hands are fettered and they are accursed for saying so. Nay, but both His hands are spread out wide in bounty. He bestoweth as He will. That which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them, and We have cast among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they light a fire for war, Allah extinguisheth it. Their effort is for corruption in the land, and Allah loveth not corrupters.\n",
      "Ayah: Say O People of the Scripture! Ye have naught (of guidance) till ye observe the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed unto you from your Lord. That which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) from thy Lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them. But grieve not for the disbelieving folk.\n",
      "Ayah: O ye who believe! Let there be witnesses between you when death draweth nigh unto one of you, at the time of bequest - two witnesses, just men from among you, or two others from another tribe, in case ye are campaigning in the land and the calamity of death befall you. Ye shall empanel them both after the prayer, and, if ye doubt, they shall be made to swear by Allah (saying): We will not take a bribe, even though it were (on behalf of) a near kinsman nor will we hide the testimony of Allah, for then indeed we should be of the sinful.\n",
      "Ayah: But then, if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit (the suspicion of) sin, let two others take their place of those nearly concerned, and let them swear by Allah, (saying): Verily our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed (the bounds of duty), for them indeed we should be of the evil-doers.\n",
      "Ayah: Say (O Muhammad): What thing is of most weight in testimony ? Say: Allah is Witness between me and you. And this Qur’an hath been inspired in me, that I may warn therewith you and whomsoever it may reach. Do ye in sooth bear witness that there are gods beside Allah ? Say: I bear no such witness. Say: He is only One God. Lo! I am innocent of that which ye associate (with Him).\n",
      "Ayah: Those who believe and obscure not their belief by wrongdoing, theirs is safety; and they are rightly guided.\n",
      "Ayah: Thus have their (so-called) partners (of Allah) made the killing of their children to seem fair unto many of the idolaters, that they may ruin them and make their faith obscure for them. Had Allah willed (it otherwise), they had not done so. So leave them alone with their devices.\n",
      "Ayah: Wait they, indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them, or thy Lord should come, or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord ? In the day when one of the portents from thy Lord cometh, its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore believed not, nor in its belief earned good (by works). Say: Wait ye! Lo! We (too) are waiting.\n",
      "Ayah: And they said: Whatever portent thou bringest wherewith to bewitch us, we shall not put faith in thee.\n",
      "Ayah: They only are the (true) believers whose hearts feel fear when Allah is mentioned, and when His revelations are recited unto them they increase their faith, and who trust in their Lord;\n",
      "Ayah: And if they break their pledges after their treaty (hath been made with you) and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief - Lo! they have no binding oaths - in order that they may desist.\n",
      "Ayah: It is not for the idolaters to tend Allah’s sanctuaries, bearing witness against themselves of disbelief. As for such, their works are vain and in the Fire they will abide.\n",
      "Ayah: O ye who believe! Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for friends, such are wrong-doers.\n",
      "Ayah: Postponement (of a sacred month) is only an excess of disbelief whereby those who disbelieve are misled; they allow it one year and forbid it (another) year, that they may make up the number of the months which Allah hath hallowed, so that they allow that which Allah hath forbidden. The evil of their deeds is made fairseeming unto them. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.\n",
      "Ayah: Make no excuse. Ye have disbelieved after your (confession of) belief. If We forgive a party of you, a party of you We shall punish because they have been guilty.\n",
      "Ayah: They swear by Allah that they said nothing (wrong), yet they did say the word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after their Surrender (to Allah). And they purposed that which they could not attain, and they sought revenge only that Allah by His messenger should enrich them of His bounty.

Lo! whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, for him Allah hath forbidden paradise. His abode is the Fire. For evil-doers there will be no helpers.\n",
      "Ayah: Satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred by means of strong drink and games of chance, and to turn you from remembrance of Allah and from (His) worship. Will ye then have done ?\n",
      "Ayah: O ye who believe! Let there be witnesses between you when death draweth nigh unto one of you, at the time of bequest - two witnesses, just men from among you, or two others from another tribe, in case ye are campaigning in the land and the calamity of death befall you. Ye shall empanel them both after the prayer, and, if ye doubt, they shall be made to swear by Allah (saying): We will not take a bribe, even though it were (on behalf of) a near kinsman nor will we hide the testimony of Allah, for then indeed we should be of the sinful.\n",
      "Ayah: I spake unto them only that which Thou commandedst me, (saying): Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. I was a witness of them while I dwelt among them, and when Thou tookest me Thou wast the Watcher over them. Thou art Witness over all things.\n",
      "Ayah: Say: I am forbidden to worship those on whom ye call instead of Allah. Say: I will not follow your desires, for then should I go astray and I should not be of the rightly guided.\n",
      "Ayah: And to establish worship and be dutiful to Him, and He it is unto Whom ye will be gathered.\n",
      "Ayah: Such is the guidance of Allah wherewith He guideth whom He will of His bondmen. But if they had set up (for worship) aught beside Him, (all) that they did would have been vain.\n",
      "Ayah: And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed, confirming that which (was revealed) before it, that thou mayst warn the Mother of Villages and those around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe herein, and they are careful of their worship.\n",
      "Ayah: Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no God save Him, the Creator of all things, so worship Him. And He taketh care of all things.\n",
      "Ayah: Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the Worlds.\n",

      "Ayah: Lo! Those who chose the calf (for worship), terror from their Lord and humiliation will come upon them in the life of the world. Thus do We requite those who invent a lie.\n",
      "Ayah: And as for those who make (men) keep the Scripture, and establish worship - lo! We squander not the wages of reformers.\n",
      "Ayah: Who establish worship and spend of that We have bestowed on them.\n",
      "Ayah: What (plea) have they that Allah should not punish them, when they debar (His servants) from the Inviolable Place of Worship, though they are not its fitting guardians. Its fitting guardians are those only who keep their duty to Allah. But most of them know not.\n",
      "Ayah: And their worship at the (holy) House is naught but whistling and hand-clapping. Therefore (it is said unto them): Taste of the doom because ye disbelieve.\n",
      "Ayah: Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.\n",
      "Ayah: How can there be a treaty with Allah and with His messenger for the idolaters save those with whom ye made a treaty at the Inviolable Place of Worship ? So long as they are true to you, be true to them. Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their duty.\n",
      "Ayah: But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have knowledge.\n",

      "Ayah: O ye who believe! The idolaters only are unclean. So let them not come near the Inviolable Place of Worship after this their year. If ye fear poverty (from the loss of their merchandise) Allah shall preserve you of His bounty if He will. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise.\n",
      "Ayah: They have taken as lords beside Allah their rabbis and their monks and the Messiah son of Mary, when they were bidden to worship only One God. There is no God save Him. Be He Glorified from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)!\n",

Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars.\n",
      "Ayah: Never stand (to pray) there. A place of worship which was found upon duty (to Allah) from the first day is more worthy that thou shouldst stand (to pray) therein, wherein are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loveth the purifiers.\n",
      "Ayah: (Triumphant) are those who turn repentant (to Allah), those who serve (Him), those who praise (Him), those who fast, those who bow down, those who fall prostrate (in worship), those who enjoin the right and who forbid the wrong and those who keep the limits (ordained) of Allah - And give glad tidings to believers!\n",

      "Ayah: They said: O Shu’eyb! Doth thy way of prayer command thee that we should forsake that which our fathers (used to) worship, or that we (should leave off) doing what we will with our own property. Lo! thou art the mild, the guide to right behaviour.\n",
      "Ayah: So be not thou in doubt concerning that which these (folk) worship. They worship only as their fathers worshipped aforetime. Lo! we shall pay them their whole due unabated.\n",
      "Ayah: Establish worship at the two ends of the day and in some watches of the night. Lo! good deeds annul ill-deeds. This is reminder for the mindful.\n",

      "Ayah: And the idolaters say: Had Allah willed, we had not worshipped aught beside Him, we and our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught without (command from) Him. Even so did those before them. Are the messengers charged with aught save plain conveyance (of the message) ?\n",

      "Ayah: Say (unto mankind): Cry unto Allah, or cry unto the Beneficent, unto whichsoever ye cry (it is the same). His are the most beautiful names. And thou (Muhammad), be not loud-voiced in thy worship nor yet silent therein, but follow a way between.\n",
      "Ayah: And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah, then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and will prepare for you a pillow in your plight.\n",
      "Ayah: And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of worship over them.\n",
      "Ayah: And (be mindful of) the Day when He will say: Call those partners of Mine whom ye pretended. Then they will cry unto them, but they will not hear their prayer, and We shall set a gulf of doom between them.\n",
      "Ayah: Say: I am only a mortal like you. My Lord inspireth in me that your God is only One God. And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord, let him do righteous work, and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord.\n",
      "Ayah: Saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord.\n",
      "Ayah: And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive,\n",
      "Ayah: When he said unto his father: O my father! Why worshippest thou that which heareth not nor seeth, nor can in aught avail thee ?\n",
      "Ayah: I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside Allah, and I shall pray unto my Lord. It may be that, in prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be unblest.\n",
      "Ayah: So, when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were worshipping beside Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a prophet.\n",
      "Ayah: He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was acceptable in the sight of his Lord.\n",
      "Ayah: Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined worship and have followed lusts. But they will meet deception.\n",
      "Ayah: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them! Therefor, worship thou Him and be thou steadfast in His service. Knowest thou one that can be named along with Him ?\n",
      "Ayah: Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto them.\n",
      "Ayah: Lo! I, even I, am Allah, There is no God save Me. So serve Me and establish worship for My remembrance.\n",
      "Ayah: And enjoin upon thy people worship, and be constant therein. We ask not of thee a provision: We provided for thee. And the sequel is for righteousness.\n",
      "Ayah: Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary;\n",
      "Ayah: And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him, (saying): There is no God save Me (Allah), so worship Me.\n",
      "Ayah: They said: We found our fathers worshippers of them.\n",
      "Ayah: He said: Worship ye then instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you ?\n",

      "Ayah: And We made them chiefs who guide by Our command, and We inspired in them the doing of good deeds and the right establishment of worship and the giving of alms, and they were worshippers of Us (alone).\n",
      "Ayah: And Noah, when he cried of old, We heard his prayer and saved him and his household from the great affliction.\n",
      "Ayah: Then We heard his prayer and removed that adversity from which he suffered, and We gave him his household (that he had lost) and the like thereof along with them, a mercy from Our store, and a remembrance for the worshippers;\n",
      "Ayah: Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish. Thus we save believers.\n",
      "Ayah: Then We heard his prayer, and bestowed upon him John, and adjusted his wife (to bear a child) for him. Lo! they used to vie one with the other in good deeds, and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear, and were submissive unto Us.\n",
      "Ayah: Lo! this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.\n",

      "Ayah: And among mankind is he who worshippeth Allah upon a narrow marge so that if good befalleth him he is content therewith, but if a trial befalleth him, he falleth away utterly. He loseth both the world and the Hereafter. That is the sheer loss.\n",
      "Ayah: Lo! those who disbelieve and bar (men) from the way of Allah and from the Inviolable Place of Worship, which We have appointed for mankind together, the dweller therein and the nomad: whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein, him We shall cause to taste a painful doom.\n",

      "Ayah: And they worship instead of Allah that for which He hath sent down no warrant, and that whereof they have no knowledge. For evil-doers there is no helper.\n",
      "Ayah: O ye who believe! Bow down and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord, and do good, that haply ye may prosper.\n",
      "Ayah: And strive for Allah with the endeavour which is His right. He hath chosen you and hath not laid upon you in religion any hardship; the faith of your father Abraham (is yours). He hath named you Muslims of old time and in this (Scripture), that the messenger may be a witness against you, and that ye may be witnesses against mankind. So establish worship, pay the poor-due, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protecting friend. A blessed Patron and a blessed Helper!\n",
      "Ayah: Who are humble in their prayers,\n",
      "Ayah: And who pay heed to their prayers.\n",
      "Ayah: Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remembrance of Allah and constancy in prayer and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when hearts and eyeballs will be overturned;\n",
      "Ayah: Hast thou not seen that Allah, He it is Whom all who are in the heavens and the earth praise, and the birds in their flight ? Of each He knoweth verily the worship and the praise; and Allah is Aware of what they do.\n",

      "Ayah: O ye who believe! Let your slaves, and those of you who have not come to puberty, ask leave of you at three times (before they come into your presence): Before the prayer of dawn, and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon, and after the prayer of night. Three times of privacy for you. It is no sin for them or for you at other times, when some of you go round attendant upon others (if they come into your presence without leave). Thus Allah maketh clear the revelations for you. Allah is Knower, Wise.\n",
      "Ayah: And on the day when He will assemble them and that which they worship instead of Allah and will say: Was it ye who misled these my slaves or did they (themselves) wander from the way ?\n",
      "Ayah: Yet they worship instead of Allah that which can neither benefit them nor hurt them. The disbeliever was ever a partisan against his Lord.\n",
      "Ayah: Say (O Muhammad, unto the disbelievers): My Lord would not concern Himself with you but for your prayer. But now ye have denied (the Truth), therefor there will be judgment.\n",

      "Ayah: And on the day when He will gather them all together, He will say unto the angels: Did these worship you ?\n",
      "Ayah: They will say: Be Thou Glorified. Thou (alone) art our Guardian, not them! Nay, but they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them.\n",
      "Ayah: And if Our revelations are recited unto them in plain terms, they say: This is naught else than a man who would turn you away from what your fathers used to worship; and they say: This is naught else than an invented lie. Those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth them: This is naught else than mere magic.\n",
      "Ayah: If ye pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they heard they could not grant it you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown association with you. None can inform you like Him Who is Aware.\n",
      "Ayah: And no burdened soul can bear another’s burden, and if one heavy laden crieth for (help with) his load, naught of it will be lifted even though he (unto whom he crieth) be of kin. Thou warnest only those who fear their Lord in secret, and have established worship. He who groweth (in goodness), groweth only for himself, (he cannot by his merit redeem others). Unto Allah is the journeying.\n",
      "Ayah: Lo! those who read the Scripture of Allah, and establish worship, and spend of that which We have bestowed on them secretly and openly, they look forward to imperishable gain,\n",
      "Ayah: Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam, that ye worship not the devil - Lo! he is your open foe! -\n",
